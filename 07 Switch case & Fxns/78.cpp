This note will be available only on first file of each folder present in folder C++ .
Documentation aka basic notes on how to run the code is already kept in each file for each programme using (/*) or //.
Wherever author needs it to be inserted, he has inserted. So that people using these files can learn easily how to code in C++ Language.
Author has made these programmes as a reference using courses of CodingHelp - By Babbar, while himself learning C++ Language for the first time.
